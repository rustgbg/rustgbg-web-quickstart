# Rust GÃ¶teborg Web Quickstart

## Installing Rust

You need a Rust toolchain to begin. Use [rustup](https://rustup.rs) for best results.

## Running

```
cargo install diesel_cli
diesel migration run
cargo run
```

You should now be able to access this from localhost:8080.

Try http://localhost:8080/example/test1 to see it working. :smile:
